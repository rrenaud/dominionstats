=============
This is the code behind http://councilroom.com. Feel free to fork it to make
it do interesting new things.

The project is run by rrenaud (rrenaud@gmail.com), with contributions so far by
Larry and rspeer.

The code depends on:

- mongodb (http://www.mongodb.org)
- pymongo (http://api.mongodb.org/python/1.9%2B/index.html)
- web.py (http://webpy.org)
- argparse (included in Python 2.7/3.2)
- simplejson (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/)

See INSTALL for instructions on how to set up the database.
